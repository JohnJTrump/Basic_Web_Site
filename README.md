# Basic_Web_Site

This project was designed around a fictional space station
which would allow a user to make reservations to go on
multiple different trips.

It shows examples of fixing objects to the page leaving
them in their place when the user scrolls through the 
contents of the page. 

This page also makes use of a contact form and other
styling features.
